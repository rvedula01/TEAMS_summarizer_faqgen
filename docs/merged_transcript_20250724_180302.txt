06/24/2025, 15:20:29 Aryan (Team Name) Hi, Neerav. Thank you so much for initiating this bridge.

06/24/2025, 15:20:29 Neerav (ABC Team) Hello, Aryan.

---------------------------------

06/24/2025, 15:20:34 Aryan (Team Name) I think nobody's just tell me one thing like which means you're trying to contact us.

06/24/2025, 15:20:34 Neerav (ABC Team) Yes, that was the first thing I wanted to ask you. We have a global number starting with plus one and maybe the Atos desk number that we use to contact in the past.

---------------------------------

06/24/2025, 15:20:55 Aryan (Team Name) OK, great. No. You can reach us by calling the service desk.

---------------------------------

06/24/2025, 15:21:03 Aryan (Team Name) If you ask them to raise a P1 and initiate a bridge, the service desk can contact us. Also, there is an option to press 7 blindly when calling the service desk number.

---------------------------------

06/24/2025, 15:21:17 Aryan (Team Name) Can you share the service number 121 with me?

06/24/2025, 15:21:23 Neerav (ABC Team) OK.

06/24/2025, 15:21:23 Aryan (Team Name) I'll do that. OK, OK. Tell me what is the issue?

---------------------------------

06/24/2025, 15:21:27 Neerav (ABC Team) OK. So it's a high critical site located in the US. It's a factory site and everyone has an eye on this site. We received an incident and found that both of the AB are not reachable to us.

---------------------------------

06/24/2025, 15:21:47 Neerav (ABC Team) We received a notification from Praveen that there is a power issue at the site, causing the AB to be unreachable. We need to initiate a P1 and send notifications as per the process.

---------------------------------

06/24/2025, 15:22:50 Aryan (Team Name) OK. Hi, Praveen. Thanks for joining the call. Can you tell me if the entire factory is down right now?

06/24/2025, 15:23:00 Praveen (GBS Team) So it's down. The network is down.

---------------------------------

06/24/2025, 15:23:03 Praveen (GBS Team) The whole plant lost power for 10 or 15 minutes, but when it came back, the telco room where some of the network gear is, the power is still bad. They're trying to figure out why. The factory itself is running, but one room with network equipment is down, impacting the entire network.

---------------------------------

06/24/2025, 15:23:27 Aryan (Team Name) OK. So right now, what applications are being impacted by this?

06/24/2025, 15:23:37 Neerav (ABC Team) All the applications.

06/24/2025, 15:23:38 Praveen (GBS Team) I think it's for that one site all. All the applications, yeah.

---------------------------------

06/24/2025, 15:23:47 Aryan (Team Name) So right now, as you have confirmed that the power is back now and still the Internet is not up. So, Neerav, what are you investigating? Like what else are we doing now?

06/24/2025, 15:24:02 Neerav (ABC Team) We are just waiting for the confirmation from the onsite users if they have checked everything is back.

---------------------------------

06/24/2025, 15:24:10 Praveen (GBS Team) No. Yeah, yeah, nothing's back because the entire network is down.

06/24/2025, 15:24:14 Neerav (ABC Team) Yeah, exactly. I was just referring to the network room, especially in the network devices, yeah.

---------------------------------

06/24/2025, 15:24:16 Praveen (GBS Team) Yeah. So the electricians are looking into the problem. OK, we're kind of helpless until the electricians get the power back in that room, OK.

---------------------------------

06/24/2025, 15:24:50 Aryan (Team Name) OK, sorry I missed that. So Praveen, you're saying that like the power is up now or it's still the iteration is working on that?

06/24/2025, 15:24:59 Praveen (GBS Team) No, no, let me say. I'm gonna say it one more time.

---------------------------------

06/24/2025, 15:25:03 Praveen (GBS Team) The main power in the building is up.

---------------------------------

06/24/2025, 15:25:09 Praveen (GBS Team) It is the room where we have some of our network equipment.

06/24/2025, 15:25:15 Praveen (GBS Team) That's why the whole network is down.

---------------------------------

06/24/2025, 15:25:29 Aryan (Team Name) So for your information for all that I have elevated this ticket to a major incident and will send a notification so.

06/24/2025, 15:25:35 Praveen (GBS Team) OK. Very good.

---------------------------------

06/24/2025, 15:25:41 Aryan (Team Name) Praveen, can you confirm that as per the electrician, how much time they will take any approx.

06/24/2025, 15:25:41 Praveen (GBS Team) They have not given me an ETA.

---------------------------------

06/24/2025, 15:30:44 Neerav (ABC Team) A poll I can see the board devices are showing up to me and I'm just logging into the devices to check and by the time you can check with the site users as well, I'm just logging into the devices.

06/24/2025, 15:31:03 Praveen (GBS Team) OK. Yeah. I'll do some checking.

---------------------------------

06/24/2025, 15:31:11 Aryan (Team Name) Thanks. Thank you, Goutham, for joining the call. So as a recap, I can tell you this is a critical site at us. Actually, there is a power failure at the site and when the power came back that there is a room network room that there have still some power issues. And for that, Praveen informed us that the electrician was working on that due to that the network devices went down and site got isolated completely. So that we have raised this up. Even so right now, as Neerav confirmed that the devices are back up.

---------------------------------

06/24/2025, 15:31:29 Aryan (Team Name) So all is checking on that and validating.

06/24/2025, 15:31:51 Goutham (Team Name) Carter, thank you.

---------------------------------

06/24/2025, 15:31:59 Neerav (ABC Team) Yes, we have the site ID, it's XXXX.

06/24/2025, 15:32:03 Goutham (Team Name) XXXX, OK. Got it. Thanks.

---------------------------------

06/24/2025, 15:36:34 Aryan (Team Name) Praveen, can you confirm when the site went down? The issue occurred.

06/24/2025, 15:37:13 Aryan (Team Name) Is 2:42 Eastern Time correct?

---------------------------------

06/24/2025, 15:38:00 Praveen (GBS Team) Shared the following in the chat: Started at 2:42 PM local time 18:42 GMT devices started to ping at 3:29 PM (19:29 GMT)

---------------------------------

06/24/2025, 15:38:33 Praveen (GBS Team) Check all devices on site, Neerav, ensure they all came up.

06/24/2025, 15:38:46 Neerav (ABC Team) Yes, I'm checking on them.

---------------------------------

06/24/2025, 15:39:56 Aryan (Team Name) Praveen, can you confirm that at 3:29 PM, the devices started working and users at the site were able to log in?

---------------------------------

06/24/2025, 15:42:04 Praveen (GBS Team) Check if the site has one power source or if the devices that went down are connected to one power source.

06/24/2025, 15:42:34 Praveen (GBS Team) We'll have to check that later, should be part of the problem ticket.

---------------------------------

06/24/2025, 15:42:59 Goutham (Team Name) Do you have the count of users impacted on the site, Praveen?

---------------------------------

06/24/2025, 15:48:20 Neerav (ABC Team) Multiple switches were power rebooted, now reachable. Some switches left, will update soon.

06/24/2025, 15:48:37 Praveen (GBS Team) On the test, some Wi-Fi APS don't seem to be joined to a controller, working on getting a list.

---------------------------------

06/24/2025, 15:57:01 Goutham (Team Name) Praveen, are you the site contact for Site?

06/24/2025, 15:57:14 Praveen (GBS Team) I'm on the global network services team.

---------------------------------

06/24/2025, 15:57:17 Goutham (Team Name) Sorry, GBS. Yeah, got it. So Praveen, does the power connectivity fall under your team or is it a general side contact issue?

06/24/2025, 15:57:40 Praveen (GBS Team) This will be handled at the local site. Contact, yeah.

---------------------------------

06/24/2025, 15:57:44 Goutham (Team Name) Okay. Aryan, can we identify the local side contact and bring them into the call?

06/24/2025, 15:57:52 Aryan (Team Name) Let me involve the user who raised the ticket.

---------------------------------

06/24/2025, 15:58:00 Praveen (GBS Team) Shared details in the chat: ABs not registering to the controller, various switches and IDs provided.

---------------------------------

06/24/2025, 16:01:12 Praveen (GBS Team) Neerav, are you still present?

06/24/2025, 16:01:17 Neerav (ABC Team) Yes, Praveen.

---------------------------------

06/24/2025, 16:01:19 Praveen (GBS Team) Switch XX seems unstable, experiencing fluctuations.

06/24/2025, 16:01:25 Neerav (ABC Team) Let me investigate. It has been up for the last 36 minutes, matching other switches. I'll check further.

---------------------------------

06/24/2025, 16:02:32 Praveen (GBS Team) Experiencing packet loss when pinging, suspecting link issues or ether channel problems.

06/24/2025, 16:02:34 Neerav (ABC Team) Understood.

---------------------------------

06/24/2025, 16:02:36 Praveen (GBS Team) Concerned about link flapping or other issues affecting connectivity.

06/24/2025, 16:02:41 Neerav (ABC Team) Agreed, encountering command delays as well.

---------------------------------

06/24/2025, 16:06:00 Gautham (Team Name) Shared update in chat: Network devices in Floura Site faced power-related downtime, now confirming stability.

---------------------------------

06/24/2025, 16:06:32 Aryan (Team Name) Thanks for joining. What's the current status of the devices?

06/24/2025, 16:06:33 Harish (Team Name) Hey.

---------------------------------

06/24/2025, 16:06:36 Aryan (Team Name) Can you provide an update on the device status?

---------------------------------

06/24/2025, 16:07:17 Goutham (Team Name) Questioning lack of backup power for network devices, planning UPS installation.

06/24/2025, 16:07:28 Harish (Team Name) Telco room relies on main power, upcoming UPS battery replacement and backup power installation.

---------------------------------

06/24/2025, 16:07:39 Goutham (Team Name) Understood.

06/24/2025, 16:07:47 Harish (Team Name) Identified issue, contractor scheduled for UPS installation in 3 weeks.

---------------------------------

06/24/2025, 16:08:01 Goutham (Team Name) Got it. OK, understood. So. All our annotesha are we still want to check further?

06/24/2025, 16:08:14 Praveen (GBS Team) Yeah, I we got we got a couple things kinda going on still, Harish.

---------------------------------

06/24/2025, 16:08:20 Praveen (GBS Team) Switch 2, which is out in the receiving area. Harish, that one seems to be going up and downesh from ABC is looking at it trying to figure out why I don't know what's going on with it, but it's unstable.

06/24/2025, 16:08:29 Harish (Team Name) Switch switch to is that's. That's the one with the. The bad second stack switch in on it. Yeah, but that was pulled out right? That's not still sitting there, is it?

---------------------------------

06/24/2025, 16:08:47 Praveen (GBS Team) Oh crap. Yep. OK. Well, I'm not sure if that's why it's having trouble being erratic. Neerav is looking into it.

---------------------------------

06/24/2025, 16:08:54 Praveen (GBS Team) I've also got three APS that have not joined the controller yet. Let me update that list and see if it's changed. One is that ABCD in the war room still there.

---------------------------------

06/24/2025, 16:09:15 Praveen (GBS Team) I don't know if you can. I I think it's close to you. I don't know if you can go in there and see what its light status is.

---------------------------------

06/24/2025, 16:09:33 Harish (Team Name) I see. I see it. ABCDE blinking green and red. What's the number of the one in the HR area?

---------------------------------

06/24/2025, 16:09:59 Neerav (ABC Team) OK, by any chance do we know about these AP? What is the uplink switch for these APS?

---------------------------------

06/24/2025, 16:10:09 Neerav (ABC Team) OK, OK, let me see. OK.

---------------------------------

06/24/2025, 16:10:33 Harish (Team Name) OK. I see the AB&T booster. HR. So there's gotta be over here.

---------------------------------

06/24/2025, 16:11:41 Harish (Team Name) Is it? Is it working? No, still not.

---------------------------------

06/24/2025, 16:11:48 Praveen (GBS Team) Was that a question for me?

---------------------------------

06/24/2025, 16:12:21 Neerav (ABC Team) Write about the switch 02. I can see any e-mail also from the support team. That there was some issue with this tech of that switch. Maybe that's why we are losing. The connectivity for that switch and for the ABCD and 04 I have bounced the port. And. Let's see if they are coming back quickly.

---------------------------------

06/24/2025, 16:13:19 Neerav (ABC Team) Sometimes they got stuck because I can see all the others. I see 43 ABD are up and they are working. Just bounced it because I have seen this in the past; AP got stuck, we bounced it, and they will be back much sooner.

---------------------------------

06/24/2025, 16:13:41 Harish (Team Name) Check if ABC is still having issues. I've checked everything in this area, and everything looks great or blue.

---------------------------------

06/24/2025, 16:13:55 Praveen (GBS Team) I'm still not seeing 4.

---------------------------------

06/24/2025, 16:14:12 Harish (Team Name) I see 12 is back, one of the ones that was down and that one came back.

---------------------------------

06/24/2025, 16:14:56 Neerav (ABC Team) 12 is not on the controller, so it's pinging.

---------------------------------

06/24/2025, 16:15:04 Harish (Team Name) I found it. It's blinking green and red. They must be downloading new code.

---------------------------------

06/24/2025, 16:15:16 Praveen (GBS Team) They must have lost their image and they gotta reload. We'll have to wait for them.

---------------------------------

06/24/2025, 16:15:27 Harish (Team Name) The Trump server is down right now.

---------------------------------

06/24/2025, 16:15:31 Praveen (GBS Team) If that's your priority, then work on that. I don't want you being on this call if you've got to work on that.

---------------------------------

06/24/2025, 16:15:43 Goutham (Team Name) We'll
