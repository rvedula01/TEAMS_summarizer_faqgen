06/24/2025, 15:20:29 A: ryan Hi, nitish. Neerav ABC/XYZ Hello, Aryan.

06/24/2025, 15:20:34 A: ryan I think nobody's just tell me one thing like which means you're trying to contact to us. Neerav ABC/XYZ Yes, that was the first thing I wanted to ask you. We have a global number starting with plus one and maybe the Atos desk number that we use to contact in the past.

06/24/2025, 15:20:55 A: ryan OK, great. No. You can reach us by calling the service desk. Neerav ABC/XYZ But I.

06/24/2025, 15:21:03 A: ryan If you ask them to raise a P1 and initiate a bridge, the service desk can contact us. Also, there is an option to press 7 blindly when calling the service desk number.

06/24/2025, 15:21:17 A: ryan Can you share the service number 121 with me? Aryan Yeah, I'll do that after the call.

06/24/2025, 15:21:23 N: eerav ABC/XYZ OK. Aryan I'll do that. OK, OK. Tell me what is the issue?

06/24/2025, 15:21:27 N: eerav ABC/XYZ OK. So it's a high critical site located in the US. It's a factory site and everyone has an eye on this site. We received an incident and found that both of the AB are not reachable to us.

06/24/2025, 15:21:34 A: ryan Mm hmm.

06/24/2025, 15:21:47 N: eerav ABC/XYZ We received a notification from Praveen that there is a power issue at the site, causing the AB to be unreachable. We need to initiate a P1 and send notifications as per the process.

06/24/2025, 15:22:50 A: ryan OK. Hi, Praveen. Thanks for joining the call. Can you tell me if the entire factory is down right now? Praveen So it's down. The network is down.

06/24/2025, 15:23:00 A: ryan Shared the following in the chat: MIM Bridge initiated. Critical Site is isolated with network.-INC02222

06/24/2025, 15:23:03 P: raveen The whole plant lost power for 10 or 15 minutes, but when it came back, the telco room where some of the network gear is, the power is still bad. They're trying to figure out why. The factory itself is running, but one room with network equipment is down, impacting the entire network.

06/24/2025, 15:23:27 A: ryan OK. So right now, what applications are being impacted by this?

06/24/2025, 15:23:37 N: eerav ABC/XYZ All the application.

06/24/2025, 15:23:38 P: raveen I think it's for that one site all. All the applications, yeah.

06/24/2025, 15:23:39 A: ryan OK.

06/24/2025, 15:23:41 N: eerav ABC/XYZ Obl.

06/24/2025, 15:23:47 A: ryan OK.

06/24/2025, 15:23:47 A: ryan So right now, as you have confirmed that the power is back now and still the Internet is not up. So, Neerav, what are you investigating? Like what else are we doing now?

06/24/2025, 15:24:02 N: eerav ABC/XYZ We are just waiting for the confirmation from the onsite users if they have checked everything is back. Now what are the?

06/24/2025, 15:24:10 P: raveen No. Yeah, yeah, nothing's back because the entire network is down.

06/24/2025, 15:24:14 N: eerav ABC/XYZ Yeah, exactly. I was just referring to the network room, especially in the network devices, yeah.

06/24/2025, 15:24:16 P: raveen Yeah. So the electricians are looking into the problem. OK, we're kind of helpless until the electricians get the power back in that room, OK.

06/24/2025, 15:24:29 N: eerav ABC/XYZ Mm hmm. Yeah, exactly.

06/24/2025, 15:24:50 A: ryan OK, sorry I missed that. So Praveen, you're saying that like the power is up now or it's still the iteration is working on that?

06/24/2025, 15:24:59 P: raveen No, no, let me say. I'm gonna say it one more time.

06/24/2025, 15:25:03 A: ryan Mm hmm.

06/24/2025, 15:25:03 P: raveen The main power in the building is up.

06/24/2025, 15:25:06 A: ryan Mm hmm.

06/24/2025, 15:25:09 P: raveen It is the room where we have some of our network equipment.

06/24/2025, 15:25:13 A: ryan OK.

06/24/2025, 15:25:15 P: raveen That's why the whole network is down.

06/24/2025, 15:25:18 A: ryan OK, OK.

06/24/2025, 15:25:29 A: ryan So for your information for all that I have elevated this ticket to a major incident and will send a notification so.

06/24/2025, 15:25:35 P: raveen OK. Very good.

06/24/2025, 15:25:41 A: ryan Praveen, can you confirm that as per the electrician, how much time they will take any approx.

06/24/2025, 15:25:41 P: raveen They have not given me an ETA.

06/24/2025, 15:25:47 A: ryan OK. They've not given me a time yet.

06/24/2025, 15:25:49 A: ryan OK, fine. I'll try to find out. Sure. Thank you.

06/24/2025, 15:30:44 N: eerav ABC/XYZ A poll I can see the board devices are showing up to me and I'm just logging into the devices to check and by the time you can check with the site users as well, I'm just logging into the devices.

06/24/2025, 15:31:03 P: raveen OK. Yeah. I'll do some checking.

06/24/2025, 15:31:11 A: ryan Thanks. Thank you, Goutham, for joining the call. So as a recap, I can tell you this is a critical site at us. Actually there is a power failure at the site and when the power came back that there is a room network room that there have still some power issues. And for that, Praveen informed us that the electrician was working on that due to that the network devices went down and site got isolated completely. So that we have raised this up. Even so right now, as Neerav confirmed that the devices are back up.

06/24/2025, 15:31:29 A: ryan So all is checking on that and validating.

06/24/2025, 15:31:51 G: outham Carter, thank you.

06/24/2025, 15:39:56 A: ryan Praveen, can you confirm that at 3:29 PM, the devices started working and users at the site were able to log in?

06/24/2025, 15:42:04 P: raveen Check if the site has one power source or if the devices that went down are connected to one power source.

06/24/2025, 15:42:34 P: raveen We'll have to check that later, should be part of the problem ticket.

06/24/2025, 15:42:59 G: outham Do you have the count of users impacted on the site, Praveen?

06/24/2025, 15:48:20 N: eerav ABC/XYZ Multiple switches were power rebooted, now reachable. Some switches left, will update soon.

06/24/2025, 15:48:37 P: raveen On the test, some Wi-Fi APS don't seem to be joined to a controller, working on getting a list.

06/24/2025, 15:52:38 N: eerav ABC/XYZ OK.

06/24/2025, 15:57:01 G: outham Praveen, are you the site contact for Site?

06/24/2025, 15:57:17 G: outham Sorry, GBS. Yeah, got it. So Praveen, does the power connectivity fall under your team or is it a general side contact issue?

06/24/2025, 15:57:40 P: raveen This will be handled at the local site. Contact, yeah.

06/24/2025, 15:57:44 G: outham Okay. Aryan, can we identify the local side contact and bring them into the call?

06/24/2025, 16:01:25 N: eerav ABC/XYZ Let me investigate. It has been up for the last 36 minutes, matching other switches. I'll check further.

06/24/2025, 16:02:32 P: raveen Experiencing packet loss when pinging, suspecting link issues or ether channel problems.

06/24/2025, 16:02:34 N: eerav ABC/XYZ Understood.

06/24/2025, 16:02:36 P: raveen Concerned about link flapping or other issues affecting connectivity.

06/24/2025, 16:02:41 N: eerav ABC/XYZ Agreed, encountering command delays as well.

06/24/2025, 16:08:14 P: raveen Yeah, I we got we got a couple things kinda going on still, Harish.

06/24/2025, 16:08:20 P: raveen Switch 2, which is out in the receiving area. Harish, that one seems to be going up and downesh from ABC is looking at it trying to figure out why I don't know what's going on with it, but it's unstable.

06/24/2025, 16:08:29 H: arish Switch switch to is that's. That's the one with the. The bad second stack switch in on it. Yeah, but that was pulled out right? That's not still sitting there, is it?

06/24/2025, 16:08:47 P: raveen Oh crap. Yep. OK. Well, I'm not sure if that's why it's having trouble being erratic. Neerav is looking into it.

06/24/2025, 16:08:54 P: raveen I've also got three APS that have not joined the controller yet. Let me update that list and see if it's changed. One is that ABCD in the war room still there.

06/24/2025, 16:09:15 P: raveen I don't know if you can. I I think it's close to you. I don't know if you can go in there and see what its light status is.

06/24/2025, 16:09:33 H: arish I see. I see it. ABCDE blinking green and red. What's the number of the one in the HR area?

06/24/2025, 16:09:59 N: eerav ABC/XYZ OK, by any chance do we know about these AP? What is the uplink switch for these APS?

06/24/2025, 16:10:09 N: eerav ABC/XYZ OK, OK, let me see. OK.

06/24/2025, 16:10:33 H: arish OK. I see the AB&T booster. HR. So there's gotta be over here.

06/24/2025, 16:11:41 H: arish Is it? Is it working? No, still not.

06/24/2025, 16:11:48 P: raveen Was that a question for me?

06/24/2025, 16:12:21 N: eerav ABC/XYZ Write about the switch 02. I can see any e-mail also from the support team. That there was some issue with this tech of that switch. Maybe that's why we are losing. The connectivity for that switch and for the ABCD and 04 I have bounced the port. And. Let's see if they are coming back quickly.

06/24/2025, 16:13:19 N: eerav ABC/XYZ Sometimes they got stuck because I can see all the others. I see 43 ABD are up and they are working. Just bounced it because I have seen this in the past; AP got stuck, we bounced it, and they will be back much sooner.

06/24/2025, 16:13:41 H: arish Check if ABC is still having issues. I've checked everything in this area, and everything looks great or blue.

06/24/2025, 16:13:55 P: raveen I'm still not seeing 4.

06/24/2025, 16:14:12 H: arish I see 12 is back, one of the ones that was down and that one came back.

06/24/2025, 16:14:56 N: eerav ABC/XYZ 12 is not on the controller, so it's pinging.

06/24/2025, 16:15:04 H: arish I found it. It's blinking green and red. They must be downloading new code.

06/24/2025, 16:15:16 P: raveen They must have lost their image and they gotta reload. We'll have to wait for them.

06/24/2025, 16:15:27 H: arish The Trump server is down right now.

06/24/2025, 16:15:31 P: raveen If that's your priority, then work on that. I don't want you being on this call if you've got to work on that.

06/24/2025, 16:15:43 G: outham We'll need somebody to give us the impact numbers and work on the RCA. This will need somebody from your end to work with the telco and fill out the form for this priority ticket.

06/24/2025, 16:16:06 H: arish Arrow send me an e-mail. I got stuff to do right now. I can I can. Deal with that in a little bit.

06/24/2025, 16:16:16 G: outham OK.

06/24/2025, 16:16:17 P: raveen OK.

06/24/2025, 16:18:10 N: eerav ABC/XYZ Praveen AB #12 is on controller. I can see it. Very good.

06/24/2025, 16:24:26 G: outham So Praveen and Neerava, should we send out a repaired com? Let everybody know the network is back up or is still not sure about that.

06/24/2025, 16:24:37 P: raveen Yeah. No. Why don't you send it out? Just tell them I'm put in there that you know, there may still be one or two wireless access points that are still down, OK.

06/24/2025, 16:24:48 G: outham Look OK.

06/24/2025, 16:31:54 P: raveen Right. I'm not sure there's any value in keeping this open. We have a couple more ABC to their downloading their code, but other than that I'm I'm I'm not. I think everything is back.

06/24/2025, 16:32:06 N: eerav ABC/XYZ Yes, Praveen. But for just to check that to make it sure I have invited Chandhan Chaudh who is from the Linux per team and have joined. So I'm just telling him the current situation if he can help us on it. Otherwise we will proceed the way you want to, OK?

06/24/2025, 16:32:30 P: raveen OK.

06/24/2025, 16:32:31 N: eerav ABC/XYZ So Chandhan, there are some ABC on the I'm just repasting those once again.

06/24/2025, 16:32:40 C: handhan ABC/DEF OK.

06/24/2025, 16:32:43 N: eerav ABC/XYZ So these are the APS which are not coming up on the controller and Praveen has verified with the help of Harish who is a local contact for this site and they are just blinking red and green.

06/24/2025, 16:32:56 C: handhan ABC/DEF Thank you.

06/24/2025, 16:32:59 N: eerav ABC/XYZ OK, we can see these are up on the DEF and we can ping the IP address of these ABC as well.

06/24/2025, 16:33:08 N: eerav ABC/XYZ I have bounced the port, port, switch, #10, port, switch #10. There are two ABC, 45 and 04. I bounced the port around 10 to 15 minutes ago but still they are not up on the controller and.

06/24/2025, 16:33:23 C: handhan ABC/DEF OK. Let me check.

06/24/2025, 16:33:25 N: eerav ABC/XYZ The.

06/24/2025, 16:33:27 N: eerav ABC/XYZ Yeah, and the switch.

06/24/2025, 16:33:29 N: eerav ABC/XYZ The last switch switch 02 is a wellknown issue. There was a running e-mail with the project team as well that there was. It's API. OK, OK. Now let me correct it. Once we one AP is 1212, which is on the switch #2.

06/24/2025, 16:34:00 P: raveen Shared the following in the chat: it's ab-02, not ap-07

06/24/2025, 16:34:05 C: handhan ABC/DEF Yeah, it's a big problem, OK. So AB 4:45 and 12:00.

06/24/2025, 16:34:12 N: eerav ABC/XYZ Yes. Their respective switches are also mentioned in front of them. OK.

06/24/2025, 16:34:18 C: handhan ABC/DEF Yeah, that will be able to let me just check on the petrol on. Yeah, I'm just logging to the computer. The causer is still loading.

06/24/2025, 16:38:38 P: raveen Sorry, we're somebody talking to me.

06/24/2025, 16:38:43 C: handhan ABC/DEF Yeah, I'm just logging to the device. The browser is still loading, just give me a few more minutes, but I will just check from the QWE and.

06/24/2025, 16:38:49 P: raveen OK.

06/24/2025, 16:46:00 C: handhan ABC Shared the following in the chat:

06/24/2025, 16:47:50 C: handhan ABC/DEF; S. Praveen What? What does that mean? Do we have to? Yeah, I can see the detail is expired error. Praveen Reconnected or. Details handshake expired the log the last connection failure I can see. I'm just checking some more info on it. Just shared the snap on the chat.

06/24/2025, 16:48:29 P: raveen Do you know what we have to do to fix it, or is that what you're looking at now?

06/24/2025, 16:48:59 A: ryan Yeah. Hi, hit. Thanks for joining again. Actually, this ticket need to be. Assigned to your group, so we need to close this in your bucket. So can you own this ticket and close it?

06/24/2025, 16:49:45 N: eerav ABC/XYZ Aryan till the time I heat is on mute. I just want to add one comment here. Whenever this kind of issue arises and they got resolved. Ticket is always resolved by us and we kept the ticket with us. So I don't think there is a reassignment required for this incident to send it to hit.

06/24/2025, 16:50:13 A: ryan OK, OK. Harish What? What? Alright, I'm here. What? What do you need from me?

06/24/2025, 16:50:20 N: eerav ABC/XYZ Yeah, Praveen gone. Praveen Yeah, yeah. So yeah, let's leave the ticket with OBS. You can. Just, you know, treat this as power and start a PBI and we'll work with Harish using your process for for the network outage in the ZXC, OK, OK.

06/24/2025, 16:50:29 N: eerav ABC/XYZ Hiya. Yeah, exactly right. Yes, yes. So Praveen, we are going to resolve this incident and with that I just want to want to know. I mean the confirmation from you, do we still need to be on this bridge for these AB or we can check in them on the background and we can send the e-mail?

06/24/2025, 16:50:52 P: raveen No. Right. I don't think you need to be on the bridge, but I would like to leave the ticket open until the at ABC are fixed. If that's OK, but but I don't think we need the bridge open because the Sev one part is resolved.

06/24/2025, 16:51:08 N: eerav ABC/XYZ For for these three ABC, for for I just adding one more comment for these three ABC, I can open one more incident and I think we can work on them on separately, OK and. Does that sound fair? Yeah. OK.

06/24/2025, 16:51:22 G: outham Yeah. Praveen OK.

06/24/2025, 16:51:25 N: eerav ABC/XYZ We'll resolve this incident OK. Praveen OK. I'm OK with that.

06/24/2025, 16:52:03 H: arish Thank you.

06/24/2025, 16:52:07 G: outham Do you need separate incidents for other issues or can we include them with the power outages?

06/24/2025, 16:52:29 G: outham Neerav, will you work on the RCA?
