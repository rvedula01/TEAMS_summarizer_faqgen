12:04 Neerav ABC Devices have been up for the last 7 minutes; adjacency is established, and most tunnels are up.

16:34 Aryan Praveen, can you confirm when the site went down?

16:45 Praveen Stand by. I'll put it in the chat.

17:13 Aryan This 2:42, that is Eastern Time, correct?

17:57 Praveen Yes, I just put the GMT in the chat; started at 2:42 PM local time, 18:42 GMT; devices started to ping at 3:29 PM (19:29 GMT).

18:01 Aryan So I'll put this as a start time.

18:33 Praveen Can you check all devices on site, Neerav, to ensure they all came up?

18:46 Neerav ABC Yes, I'm just checking on them.

18:52 Praveen Thank you.

19:56 Aryan So Praveen, you're confirming that at 3:29 PM, the devices started working, and users at the site can log in or use their operations?

20:09 Praveen I'll have to check with them. I haven't talked to the end users. I've been looking at the network, but let me try to reach out to a couple of guys.

22:04 Praveen They are checking all their services, so just stand by.

22:10 Goutham Is the site having just one power source, or are the devices that went down connected to one power source? Can we check that in parallel?

22:34 Praveen We'll have to check that. We'll have to ask them afterwards. That should be part of the problem ticket. I think it was a major issue from the substation that caused the power to be down.

22:43 Goutham OK.

22:51 Praveen We have to check on the demo. We'll have to ask them, but that should be part of the problem ticket.

22:59 Goutham Got it. Praveen, do you have the count of users impacted on the particular site?

27:23 Praveen I do not know.

27:26 Goutham OK.

28:20 Neerav ABC I have seen multiple switches; all were power rebooted, but now they are reachable. Some are left, and I will update soon.

28:36 Goutham Thanks, Neerav.

28:37 Praveen On the test, I see a couple of Wi-Fi APs don't seem to be joined to a controller. I'm trying to get a list right now.

32:38 Neerav ABC OK.

37:01 Goutham Just for my understanding, Praveen, you're the site contact for the site, right?

37:08 Praveen No, I am on the network team. I'm on the global network services team.

37:13 Goutham Oh, it's GBS.

37:14 Praveen Yeah, GBS.

37:17 Goutham Sorry, GBS.
