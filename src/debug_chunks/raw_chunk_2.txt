**Observations/Follow-Up**
• The application team needs to figure out what went wrong after the server rebooted. • The timelines have been given by cloud OPS and they will coordinate work with them if required. • Once a ticket is resolved at the P1 level, it cannot be downgraded to P2. • A problem record will be created and assigned to the teams, and all teams are required to join the call for the problem team.
